									<p>
										The origins of progressive metal can be traced back to progressive
										rock bands from the late 1960s and early to mid-1970s such as Yes,
										Pink Floyd, Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Jethro Tull, King Crimson,
										Genesis, Gentle Giant, Focus, early Queen, Kansas, Atomic Rooster,
										Uriah Heep, and Rush. The latter 5 also often blended metal elements
										into their music. However, progressive metal did not develop into a
										genre of its own until the mid-1980s. Bands such as Rainbow had many
										qualities of progressive metal. Bands such as Fates Warning,
										Queensrÿche and Dream Theater took elements of these progressive rock
										groups – primarily the instrumentation and compositional structure of
										songs – and merged them with heavy metal styles associated with early
										Metallica and Megadeth. The result could be described as a progressive
										rock mentality with heavy metal sounds.

										Progressive metal received mainstream exposure in the early 1990s when
										Queensrÿche's "Silent Lucidity" (from 1990's Empire) became a radio
										and MTV hit. It was not a typical progressive metal song, but its
										popularity increased the profile of other progressive metal bands. In
										1993, Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under" (from 1992's Images and Words)
										became popular on radio and MTV. In the 1990s, bands such as Pain of
										Salvation, Opeth, Ayreon, and Symphony X developed their own signature
										sounds.

										Pain of Salvation drew heavily on more obscure 1970s prog acts. Ayreon
										stayed with the traditional Prog Metal themes, but mixed them with
										rock opera influences. Symphony X married progressive elements to
										power metal, bridging the gap between the two sub-genres. Steve Vai's
										former singer and heavy metal band Strapping Young Lad's singer and
										guitarist Devin Townsend combined elements of post metal and ambient
										with traditional progressive metal on his first two solo albums Ocean
										Machine: Biomech and Infinity. Opeth combined their prog influence
										with death metal. Another influence on prog metal was
										"technical metal" bands, such as Meshuggah, Watchtower, Between The
										Buried and Me, Last Chance to Reason, Suraj SYnthesist, Atheist and
										Cynic, which played complex song structures and used virtuoso
										instrumental playing.

										Bands like Sun Caged, Dominici and Circus Maximus are influenced by
										traditional progressive metal and several of the first wave of 1990s
										bands. Bands such as Dark Suns, Disillusion, or Conscience are
										influenced by emotional progressive metal bands like Opeth, Pain of
										Salvation, Green Carnation and Anathema. Sweden's Tiamat have also
										been influential in the progressive metal genre, especially on their
										1994's breakthrough-album Wildhoney.

								<div class="sticky__block">Djent</div>
								<div class="sticky__content">
									<p>
										Djent (pronounced “gent”) is an umbrella term for a subgenre of heavy
										metal music and a style of progressive metal identifiable by its
										repetitive power chords, unusual time signatures, and the use of
										polyrhythms, or two different and contrasting rhythms within the same
										musical composition. The term “djent” is an onomatopoeia credited to
										Fredrik Thordendal, guitarist for the Swedish extreme metal band
										Meshuggah. Frederik reportedly used the term to describe the band’s
										guitar sound: crunching, four-note riffs marked by high gain—a
										distorted, “dirty” guitar tone—and palm-muting, in which the
										guitarist’s strumming hand lightly touches the strings to deaden the
										tone and lend weight or “chug” to their sound.

										Djent began trending with an online community of musicians and soon
										came to describe a style of music that embraced several metal
										subgenres—including metalcore and iterations of math metal like
										mathcore—and utilized complicated rhythms and heavy riffs. Guitarist
										Misha Mansoor, a.k.a. Bulb, of the prog metal band Periphery, has
										received credit for uniting these groups under the rubric of djent
										metal. Critics and fans alike consider Animals as Leaders, Tesseract,
										Textures, and Sikth to be foundational groups of the djent scene.

										The djent sound has attracted numerous other musicians and bands,
										including Paul Antonio Ortiz (who also performs under the pseudonym
										Chimp Spanner) and Monuments. Several prog metal and metal bands, like
										Veil of Maya, Xerath, and Vildhjarta, have folded “djenty” elements
										into their music. Deathcore and progressive death metal acts, such as
										Born of Osiris, also use elements of the sound along with nu-metal
										bands like Hacktivist, who merge djent metal with rapping.

										Several characteristics define djent music, including:

										1. Chug: The term “djent” is a nod to the high-gain, low-pitch,
										palm-muted guitar “chug” of extreme heavy metal and other metal
										genres. Djent guitarists like Acle Kahney of Tesseract often wield
										exceptional technicality in playing but boost the gain on their amp or
										employ guitar processors to reproduce the dissonant djent sound.
										Sweden’s proto-djent band Meshuggah played eight-string guitars to add
										crushing layers of chug to their music.
										2. Polyrhythm: The use of two contrasting rhythms within the same
										song, or polyrhythm, is an earmark of djent music. While some African,
										Latin, and classical music styles also utilize polyrhythms, djent
										music uses them to lend a groove and beat to their heavy and
										technically complex sound.
										3. Prog metal roots: Djent shares many of the elements that define
										prog metal. Both subgenres use extended solos, syncopated rhythms,
										repetitive riffs, unique melody structures, and time signatures. Djent
										and prog metal also echo various influences, from jazz fusion and
										ambient sounds to hardcore, thrash, and black metal.
										4 Popular Djent Bands
										Here are some of the most notable djent bands:

										1. After the Burial: The Minneapolis, Minnesota–based prog metal band
										After the Burial has managed to issue six full-length albums despite
										incredible upheaval during their 17-year history, including the death
										of co-founder and rhythm guitarist Justin Lowe and numerous band
										roster changes.
										2. Cloudkicker: Commercial airline pilot Ben Sharp is the sole
										architect behind the post-metal/prog metal band Cloudkicker. He
										composes, engineers, and records all the music himself. Though he has
										professed a dislike for touring, the Ohio-based Ben hit the road with
										fellow djent band Tesseract in 2014.
										3. ERRA: Birmingham, Alabama’s ERRA mixes metalcore and progressive
										metal with elements of melodic and ambient sounds for their signature
										sonic attack. They wield considerable influence over the metalcore and
										prog metal scenes through five albums and frequent touring with other
										djent groups.
										4. Periphery: The Grammy-nominated band Periphery is one of the
										founding acts of the djent movement, with guitarist Misha Mansoor
										serving as one of the primary architects of developing the loose
										tenets of the djent sound. The band has forged connections with other
										djent groups, including Tesseract, The Safety Fire, and Monuments.
										They traveled the country with Tesseract and Monument on the League of
										Extraordinary Djentlemen tour to promote their self-titled debut album
										in 2014.

								<div class="sticky__block">Tech/Extreme Prog Metal</div>
								<div class="sticky__content">
									<p>
										This category lists technical Progressive Metal bands that have roots
										in Extreme Metal or that are strongly influenced by it. The style
										developed by the end of the 80s in the Thrash Metal scene when a
										number of bands stretched the boundaries of their sound by including
										elements from Progressive Rock. Death Metal followed a similar path in
										the 90s and by the 2000s, also Black Metal and Metalcore saw an
										increasing amount of bands taking in Prog influences.

										Certain bands like EPHEL DUATH and UNEXPECT developed a style that
										largely abandoned their extreme metal heritage in favour of a highly
										eclectic jazz-influenced Avant Metal style. These bands are listed
										under Experimental Metal.

										Progressive Thrash Metal
										By the end of the 80s Thrash Metal had diversified its sound
										significantly to an extent where the originally very direct and
										uncompromisingly aggressive style had become more sophisticated,
										boasting challenging technical skills and ambitious song structures
										frequently surpassing the 6 minute mark. The best known examples are
										METALLICA and MEGADETH.

										The bands listed in this section went one step further and embraced
										notable influences from Progressive Rock, replacing much of the
										typical Thrash Metal riffs and rhythms with a more progressive and
										melodic riffing style, influenced by KING CRIMSON and RUSH. The most
										well-known of these early bands was VOIVOD, who also brought the early
										psychedelic sound of PINK FLOYD into their unique mold. Important
										pioneering albums were released by WATCHTOWER, CORONER, MEKONG DELTA,
										as well as the debut album of SIEGES SEVEN.
										More recent examples of Progressive Thrash are SPIRAL ARCHITECT and
										VEKTOR

										Progressive Death Metal
										Death Metal further built on the sound of the most extreme bands of
										the Thrash scene. Next to the brutal sound, blast beat drumming,
										complex song structures and multiple tempo changes, the most notorious
										feature of the style is probably the growled vocals. Death Metal is
										generally highly technical, making the dividing line between Technical
										Death Metal and Progressive Death Metal sometimes rather faint.

										The bands considered for Prog Archives are those that show significant
										influences from Progressive Rock and/or Fusion. One of the landmarks
										in the style is "Elements" from ATHEIST, who mixed their
										hyper-technical Speed Metal with fusion. Other early albums include
										"Focus" from CYNIC and "Spheres" from PESTILENCE, where progressive
										riffing, polymetrics, fusion influences and atmospheric keyboards
										complemented their brutal Death Metal. Also DEATH, the popular founder
										of Death Metal, incorporated fusion and progressive elements on their
										later albums.

										A different flavour of Progressive Death Metal came from the European
										continent, when half-way into the 90s leading death and doom-death
										bands started expanding their basic metal sound. The most significant
										album relevant to this section is "Crimson" from EDGE OF SANITY. In
										typical Scandinavian fashion, their epic approach wasn't fusion
										oriented but less technical and more melodic, introducing the now
										typical alteration between brutal Death sections and more melodic
										breaks with clean vocals; an approach perfected in the next decade by
										OPETH.

										Progressive Black Metal
										Unlike Thrash and Death metal, Black Metal is not a technical genre.
										Originally it was even purposely non-technical and low-fi. By the end
										of the 90s the genre had developed into various sub-styles, of which
										some incorporated elements from progressive music.
										The bands listed in this section are Black Metal bands that traded the
										minimalism of Black Metal for a more progressive, technical or
										experimental approach. This distinguishes them from the Black Metal
										bands that fleshed out their sound with either post-rock and/or
										shoegaze influences. Those are listed under Experimental/Post Metal.

										One of the earliest and best known example of this style is ENSLAVED,
										who maintained the harsh atmosphere and aggression of classic Black
										Metal but extended this with a more textured psychedelic sound,
										chromatic riffing and odd time-signatures, citing influences from PINK
										FLOYD, VOIVOD and KING CRIMSON. Also IHSAHN, front-man of EMPEROR,
										should be mentioned here.

										Most artists in this section are Symphonic Black Metal-oriented bands
										with progressive and experimental influences, but without fully
										crossing over to either Prog or Avant Metal as they remain
										oppressively dark, harsh, often dissonant and inaccessible. Their
										strong ties to Black Metal is why they are featured under Tech/Extreme
										Prog Metal and not in Avant Prog Metal. Examples are DEATHSPELL OMEGA,
										MOONSORROW, NEGURA BUNGET and the slightly more accessible theatrical
										Symphonic Black Metal of ARCTURUS.

										Modern Phase
										In the 2000s trends became more diffuse, introducing bands that had
										some of their stylistic features in common with the extreme metal
										genres without fully belonging in any of them. Some of them continued
										the strong fusion element and hyper-technical approach from ATHEIST
										and CYNIC. Instrumental acts such a as EXIVIOUS, CANVAS SOLARIS and
										BLOTTED SCIENCE received lots of critical acclaim from progressive
										metal fans.

										A new trend was set by MESHUGGAH, one of the most defining bands of
										this era. At the end of the 90s their eclectic mix of Death, Thrash,
										Avant, Fusion and Prog laid down the groundrules of Extreme Metal for
										the next decade. Another well known band to take a similar eclectic
										approach to Extreme Metal was GOJIRA.
										In the second half of the 2000's, many young bands copied MESHUGGAH's
										guitar tone and rhythmical riffing style, giving rise to the so-called
										'djent' movement. Many of these bands belong in Tech/Extreme, such as
										ANIMALS AS LEADERS, CHIMP SPANNER etc.

										Progressive Metalcore
										The second half of the 2000s also saw the rise of a new generation of
										Progressive Tech/Extreme acts with roots that lay in Metalcore,
										Mathcore and Technical Sludge, rather then the 'classic' Extreme Metal
										genres. Their music is inherently technical and complex and has quite
										a number of formal features in common with Progressive Metal such as
										odd time signatures and non-standard song formats.
										Prog Archives only lists these bands that go beyond the default
										expectations of the genre and bring in distinct non-extreme Prog
										influences. Some of the most eye-catching bands in this area are
										BETWEEN THE BURIED AND ME, PROTEST THE HERO, BURST, DILLINGER ESCAPE
										PLAN and MASTODON.

								<div class="sticky__block">Experimental Progressive Metal</div>
								<div class="sticky__content">
									<p>
										Experimental progressive metal is a sub-genre of progressive metal
										characterized by the incorporation of innovative, eclectic elements,
										large-scale experimentation and the use of non-standard and
										unconventional sounds, instruments, song structures, playing styles,
										and vocal techniques. Experimentation in the music is a major criteria
										to define the genre where artists often add unique elements to the
										overall sound, while progressive metal usually has more focus on
										traditional metal instrumentation and higher levels of technical
										complexity.

										It's nearly impossible to pinpoint the exact origin of Experimental
										Progressive Metal since experimentation is common in all music genres.
										Still it is clear that experimentation in the progressive metal
										sub-genre has slowly but steadily grown in popularity ever since its
										humble beginnings in the early 1980s.

										Just like any other style, Experimental Progressive Metal has a few
										defining moments that have changed the rules for its sub-genre for
										years to come. Two of such moments are the releases of the debut album
										by MR.BUNGLE of August 1991 and its iconic follow up "Disco Volante"
										of 1995. MR BUNGLE became notorious for their heavy sound and mid-song
										shifts of musical style. The band has later spawned an array of
										established avant-garde side projects such as FANTÔMAS, SECRET CHIEFS
										3 and ESTRADASPHERE but also inspired new Experimental Metal acts to
										take the music scene to new heights.
										Another crucial artist in the development of Experimental Progressive
										Metal was the leading Avant Metal band of the 80s, CELTIC FROST. Their
										eclectic mix of Thrash, Doom, Symphonic and Goth Metal created a dark
										theatrical mystique that became a major influence among the
										experimental Extreme Metal bands of the 90s such as MY DYING BRIDE,
										ULVER, ARCTURUS among others. These bands served as an important
										source of inspiration for the experimental movement within extreme
										metal.

										The bands listed under Experimental Progressive Metal have all, in
										various degrees, shed their extreme heritage in favor of embracing
										influences of the eclectic style going from art rock and ethnic up to
										free-jazz and even modernist music.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="sticky__block">Art Metal, Eclectic Metal, Avant-garde
									Metal</div>
								<div class="sticky__content">
									<p>
										Art metal is a direct continuation of progressive metal but with the
										longing to expand the themes and styles of music while maintaining the
										technical complexity of the sub-genre.
										These bands are more artistic than their progressive metal peers and
										tend to experiment, to a certain extent, but not as openly as the
										bands of the eclectic and avant-garde metal styles. Art metal comes in
										many shapes and forms. The virtuosity and complete unpredictability of
										DEVIN TOWNSEND, OSI and TOOL always manages to draw attention of both
										fans of traditional metal as well as the progressive music audience,
										while bands like ANATHEMA, DEADSOUL TRIBE and GORDIAN KNOT attract
										many fans of groove and atmospheric music into their vibrant
										soundscapes. Other notable acts include GREEN CARNATION, DARK SUNS and
										ANTIMATTER.

										These bands often add unconventional elements to their metal sound,
										whether it's experiments with various new sounds and styles that are
										otherwise uncommon in metal or by blending many styles, with metal
										being the referential core. Whether it's the ethnic elements of
										ORPHANED LAND's music that combines Middle Eastern folklore with the
										more traditional progressive metal sound or a completely unique mix of
										atmospheric, almost ambient, elements fused with metal that can be
										found in the sound of THE GATHERING, eclectic metal artists will
										always certainly bring a host of different styles and ideas to the
										table. Experimental metal can be found in numerous forms while
										featuring notable acts like INDUKTI, IN THE WOODS... and MAUDLIN OF
										THE WELL.

										This style is generally considered to be more extreme in both its
										arrangements but most importantly extremely complex and unpredictable
										song structures. Compositions have the ambition of trying to breach
										boundaries of music and generally have significant experimental
										approaches to metal music. Most of this music borders on the realms of
										pure avant-garde while still maintaining a solid foundation in metal
										with technical instrumental prowess. Notable acts include UNEXPECT,
										EPHEL DUATH and VIRUS.

									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="sticky__block">Post Metal</div>
								<div class="sticky__content">
									<p>
										Post metal arose following the subsequent emergence of numerous newer,
										grittier metal genres like sludge, stoner, doom, and drone in the late
										80's and early 90's, as well as the budding post-rock scene that
										emerged in the early 90's in Europe and North America. The scene's
										origins can be heard in several distinctly like-minded, moderately
										experimental groups in the early 90's, ranging from the noisy grind of
										GODFLESH, the sludgy, melodic, sometimes punk-like riffs of the
										MELVINS, and the proggy time signatures and grungy riffing of TOOL or
										HELMET, to the textural work of DON CABALLERO and the more melodic
										moments of early BARK PSYCHOSIS.

										Arguably the first true and definitive realizations of post-metal
										emerged in the mid 1990's. The most concrete example was NEUROSIS, who
										moved farther away from their crust-punk origins and into more
										atmospheric territories with releases like Souls at Zero and Through
										Silver in Blood, the latter album in particular being regarded as one
										of the most definitive releases in the genre even to this day for its
										revolutionary blend of dark, spanning atmosphere and massively heavy
										sludge, something that would later come to define the post-metal genre
										as a whole (indeed, post-metal is often called "atmospheric sludge" as
										well). It wouldn't be until the early 2000's, however, that the
										genre's capacity would be fully realized, with releases like ISIS's
										"Oceanic", CULT OF LUNA's "Salvation", and PELICAN's "Australasia"
										paving the way for a true scene to emerge, and post-metal has since
										become a widespread phenomenon that has captivated the attention of
										many adventurous listeners worldwide.

										Post-metal's unique sound is often very long and extremely drawn-out,
										utilizing oft-repetitive and simple riffs and guitar texturing to
										create massive buildups and musical climaxes. At times very
										emotionally evocative, it can be equally soft and soothing as it can
										be massively dense and crushing. Vocals are used sparingly, if at all
										(instrumental post-metal is a popular genre, with groups like PELICAN
										and RUSSIAN CIRCLES even achieving some degree of mainstream
										credibility), and when they are, they're usually gruff and barked as
										opposed to growled or screamed, a signature trait of the genre's
										hardcore roots.

										While it should be noted that many post-metal bands have their roots
										in sludge metal, there are many post-metal bands that are rooted in
										other genres of metal. While post-sludge was an almost uniquely
										American phenomenon, a number of European doom-influenced post-metal
										bands have risen to fame, namely groups like ANATHEMA, YEAR OF NO
										LIGHT and CALLISTO; their slow-churning riffs and depressing mood of
										doom metal fit very well into the post-metal formula. These groups
										later gave way to more western post-doom-metal projects like JESU,
										GIANT SQUID, and MINSK.

										A number of post-metal bands are significantly influenced by hardcore
										and post-hardcore, crafting the melodic elements of modern hardcore
										into their own brands of textural and atmospheric post-metal. This is
										exemplified by groups like ROSETTA, THE OCEAN COLLECTIVE, CAVE IN,
										MOUTH OF THE ARCHITECT and BURST.

										A subgenre that has emerged to a considerable degree in the last
										decade is an amalgamation of post-rock and black metal. Black metal
										has traditionally not been a stylistic influence on post-metal over
										the years, but bands like ALCEST, FEN, AGALLOCH and ALTAR OF PLAGUES
										have used the more atmospheric qualities of black metal and the
										tremolo riffing and incorporated it with a shoegaze-like affinity for
										heavy, dreamy sounds and guitar effects to create a unique and
										evocative subgenre that shares many visional and sonic characteristics
										of post-metal. While the explosion of bands exploring this style is a
										rather recent phenomenon, there are some instances of this occurring
										very early in the lifespan of the post-metal genre as a whole. ULVER's
										debut could be seen as possibly the first album to fall under this
										definition. For clarification's sake, these post-rock influenced bands
										are placed in the post-metal subsection of ProgArchives as opposed to
										the black metal subsection of Tech/Extreme because they eschew much of
										the harsh tonalities, minor modes, and shrieking vocals of black metal
										and add a melodic and emotional aspect that makes it much more
										accessible than their progressive black metal peers in the
										tech/extreme section.

										Today, the most popular post-metal groups are much of the genre's
										godfathers like ISIS, NEUROSIS, PELICAN, and CULT OF LUNA, though a
										number of newer bands have risen to fame in metal and prog circles
										within the last 5 years like INTRONAUT, ROSETTA, and THE OCEAN
										COLLECTIVE.
